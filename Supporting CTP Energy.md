# Supporting CTP Energy: The [Disclosure](https://www.github.com/ctp-eos/ctp-is-disclosure) and Invitation to Support Independent DeepTech Innovation

## Overview

**CTP Energy, LLC** is an early-stage independent corporate research initiative and startup dedicated to pioneering a new scientific paradigm we term **CTP Energy Science**. We are committed to advancing radically innovative research in the fields of:

- **Hyper-spatial energetics**
- **Remote biological sensing**
- **Nonlocal information transport**
- The eventual realization of advanced **CTP Gravitic Propulsion Systems**

We maintain full transparency with our readers, supporters, and the scientific community at large. This article serves as both a **disclosure** and **support invitation** for those who wish to participate — indirectly but meaningfully — in the growth and mission of CTP Energy early-stages.

## Why You May See Amazon Affiliate Links in Our Articles

In many of our research articles, documentation pages, and knowledge repositories, you may notice that references to relevant scientific books or literature are occasionally linked to their listings on **Amazon**. These links may include an **Amazon Associates ID** affiliated with CTP Energy.

> **What this means:**  
> If you click through one of these links and make a purchase — _any_ qualifying purchase within that session, not just the linked item — CTP Energy may earn a small commission at **no additional cost to you**.

You may encounter these links in:

- Scientific reference sections of articles  
- Bibliographies and reading recommendations  
- Annotated research documentation  
- Curated reading lists and conceptual frameworks

## 100% Independent Operation: No External Funding (Yet)

As of this writing, **CTP Energy:**

- Has received **no government grants**
- Has received **no institutional science funding**
- Has **not yet** raised capital through angel investors, VCs, or private equity
- Is **100% independently operated** by its founding members and early contributors

All research, publishing, infrastructure, and early prototyping is **self-funded**. This includes:

- Computing resources
- Server and web infrastructure
- Design and branding
- Outreach and communications
- All science documentation and publishing

This means that even modest earnings from affiliate links help us:

- Maintain publishing infrastructure  
- Acquire tools, sensors, and test gear  
- Fund continued research and documentation  
- Prepare for future scaling and operations  
- Begin groundwork for eventual CTP technologies

## How Affiliate Earnings Are Used

All earnings from affiliate programs (including Amazon Associates) are:

- ✅ Reinvested directly into CTP Energy, LLC operations  
- ✅ Used to fund open-access research publications  
- ✅ Applied to theoretical tech prototyping *(e.g. sensors, energy platforms)* 
- ✅ Supporting future hiring, education, and outreach  

> **Important:** None of these funds are used for personal gain or enrichment. Every dollar supports the **[mission of CTP Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwU06YUJRAk)**.

## Your Clicks Support Scientific Progress

We recognize the skepticism around affiliate monetization in scientific circles. However, we believe that **radically open science** — especially in emerging fields — requires:

- Transparency  
- Integrity  
- Practical support mechanisms

By clicking reference links and making purchases, you help:

- Disseminate under-recognized scientific ideas  
- Support experimental work in neglected frontier science  
- Build foundations for future CTP Technologies (e.g. **CTP Gravitic Craft**)  
- Decentralize innovation funding away from establihed paradigm institutional gatekeeping
- Our world completely dismissed/ignored Drazen over 20 years ago.
- We could already be a multiplanetary civilization - TODAY - if Drazen/CTP Energy had receivered more traction/support over 20 years ago!

## A Final Word: Support Without Compromise

> We will **never compromise our editorial integrity**.  
> We will only ever reference books and materials we believe are **genuinely valuable** to our readers and mission.

If you choose to purchase through our links, you become part of a growing movement supporting one of the boldest deeptech projects of the 21st century.

*"The next revolution in science is the revolution of Consciousness, itself! This is the CTPSci scienctific revolution! It will not be contained, confined, or gatekept behind institutional heirarchy of today's materialist academia paradigm. We are a private institution at the spearhead of a global planetary movement and open-source **new conscious initiative"**. It is CTP and CTP Energy that will bring to you all future UFO/UAP or CTP Technologies! Your early-stage support is both required and appreciated! Thank you!*
