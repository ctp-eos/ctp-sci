# Creating CTP: The UFO Deeptech Startup

**Creating CTP: The UFO Deeptech Startup** refers to **CTP Energy**, a deeptech startup that claims to be developing advanced propulsion technologies based on a new scientific framework called **CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)**. This framework is attributed to **Drazen Premate**, who is described as the *"unsung successor to Nikola Tesla."* The startup's mission is to advance humanity's technological capabilities to match or surpass those of extraterrestrial civilizations.

## Core Concepts and Technologies

### üîπ CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)
A **post-quantum scientific model** that purportedly extends beyond the Standard Model of physics. It introduces new fundamental forces and principles, particularly focusing on the manipulation of gravity and energy through what is termed "**C-energy**."  
This model is said to enable technologies like **faster-than-light propulsion** and **advanced energy systems**.

### üîπ CTP Gravitic Propulsion
A propulsion system that allegedly operates by **modulating gravitational forces**, distinguishing it from traditional electromagnetic or chemical propulsion methods.  
This technology is claimed to be the basis for **UFO-like craft**, referred to as *"CTPcraft."* These systems are said to utilize **CTP Energy** to achieve high-efficiency, **anti-gravitic flight**.

### üîπ CTP Spaceliners and Personal Spacecraft
The startup envisions the development of **commercial space travel solutions**, including:

- **CTP Spaceliners** for interplanetary travel  
- **Personal spacecraft** for individual use  

These concepts are based on the application of CTP Gravitic Propulsion and are projected to become feasible within the **next decade**, contingent upon successful development and scaling.

## Could a Deeptech Startup Building Working UFOs Become the Biggest Show on TV?

*Imagine a docu-series that follows a real startup racing to build working UFOs. Not just rehashing old sightings, but showing credible engineers, real breakthroughs, and behind-the-scenes drama as it happens. Could this become the biggest show on television?*

---

## Why This Story Has Blockbuster Potential

**Universal Fascination with UFOs**  
UFOs and the search for advanced technology have captivated audiences for decades. Recent series like *UFOs: Investigating the Unknown* have already proven there‚Äôs a massive audience for credible, fact-based explorations of the unknown.

**Success of Tech and Mystery Docu-Series**  
Shows that blend high-stakes innovation, real-world mystery, and dramatic storytelling‚Äîthink *Formula 1: Drive to Survive* or *MH370: The Plane That Disappeared*‚Äîhave drawn tens of millions of viewers worldwide. A UFO deeptech startup story would combine cutting-edge science with the intrigue of the unexplained.

**A Unique, High-Concept Hook**  
Unlike typical startup stories, the quest to actually build a working UFO would be unprecedented. If the series documents real engineering efforts, setbacks, and possible breakthroughs, it would offer something no other show has: the potential to witness history in the making.

---

## How Would It Compare to Top Shows?

UFO docuseries already attract millions‚Äîeven without the drama of a real-time technological race. If a show could credibly document a startup making real progress toward building a UFO, it could easily surpass the popularity of current UFO series and rival the biggest documentary hits.

---

## What Would Make It the Biggest Show?

- **Authenticity**: Real engineers, real tech, real stakes‚Äînot just speculation.
- **Access**: Unprecedented behind-the-scenes access to founders, investors, and the technical process.
- **Narrative Stakes**: The possibility of a world-changing breakthrough, with all the attendant drama, failure, and hope.
- **Perfect Timing**: In an era of renewed interest in UFOs and government disclosures, the timing couldn‚Äôt be better.

---

## Conclusion

A well-produced docu-series about a deeptech startup attempting to build working UFOs could easily become one of the biggest shows on TV. The combination of technological ambition, mystery, and the universal allure of the UFO phenomenon gives it blockbuster potential.

*Would you watch?*

---

### Final Thought

CTP Energy's show idea is more scalable, more monetizable, and more culturally disruptive than *Skinwalker Ranch*, if presented with cinematic quality, startup intensity, and genuine science-rebel tone.

- We‚Äôre not chasing lights in the sky.
- We‚Äôre building the ships.
