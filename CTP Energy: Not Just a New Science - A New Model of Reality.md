# CTPSci: Not Just a New Non-Physical Science—A Completely New Postquantum Epistemological Model of Reality

## Introduction: The Limits of the Known

Since the early 20th century, quantum physics has irrevocably changed our understanding of the physical world, replacing the clockwork certainties of classical mechanics with the statistical probabilities of subatomic interactions. Yet even quantum mechanics, with all its strangeness, remains tethered to a materialist and reductionist framework—a model in which the observer is peripheral, and consciousness is a puzzling afterthought.

CTP Energy Science goes beyond. It doesn't merely suggest a new non-physical layer of nature—it offers a **postquantum epistemology**, a framework for *knowing* and *interacting with* a reality where consciousness, intent, and nonlocal fields are not anomalies, but fundamentals. It is the first epistemological system to **integrate consciousness, biofield phenomena, and nonlocal information transfer** into a unified model of reality, extending science into domains long excluded as “woo” or metaphysical[^1][^2].

## Section I: Beyond Physics — The Need for a Postquantum Paradigm

Physics as we know it has been governed by empirical, measurable frameworks. From Newton to Einstein to Schrödinger, the universe has been interpreted as a set of externally verifiable data points. Yet, countless phenomena—ranging from anomalous cognition to biological nonlocality—defy this empirical scaffolding.

What if these phenomena aren't exceptions, but **essential features** of reality?

**CTP Energy Science (Consciousness-Translational Phenomenal Energy)** challenges the assumption that matter-energy is the primary substrate of existence. It proposes a **field-based, consciousness-centric model** where reality itself is modulated by information fields not bound by time, space, or classical causality[^3].

In this view, *observation doesn’t just influence reality—it helps construct it*[^4].

## Section II: The Foundation of CTP Energy Science

At its core, CTP Energy Science is built on new central axioms:

1. **Consciousness as Primary Substrate**  
   Reality emerges from consciousness, not the other way around. This view aligns with ancient wisdom systems and modern theoretical propositions from physicists like John Archibald Wheeler[^5], David Bohm[^6], and Amit Goswami[^7].

2. **Nonlocal Biological Coupling**  
   Biological systems are not isolated. They are coupled via *informational fields* that allow for **real-time signaling and coordination** beyond the electromagnetic spectrum. This is supported by research such as Cleve Backster’s plant consciousness experiments[^8], Luc Montagnier’s DNA teleportation[^9], and peer-reviewed studies in biocommunication[^10].

3. **Hyper-Spatial Information Transfer**  
   The universe includes a **hyper-spatial layer**—a multidimensional informational infrastructure through which “CTP fields” propagate. These fields encode emotion, intent, memory, and potentiality, interacting with biological substrates to generate experience[^11][^12].

4. **Two New Post-Quantum Fundamental Forces Outside of the Standard Model of Physics**      
  In order to facilite the **CTP Model** required to complete the ***Theory of Everything*** and solve the total fundamental nature of reality and inter-domain existences is the requirement of two new (albeit) non-physical Fundamental Forces and non-physical energy/non-physical energies unified WITH known physics.
  
## Section III: CTP as Epistemology — Not Just New Physics, but Knowing: Accounting for New Forces and the Abstract CTP Reality Layer (C-Domain)

CTP Energy Science introduces a *new epistemological mode*—a way of structuring human knowledge that transcends third-party empirical reductionism.

This epistemology acknowledges:

- **Participatory knowing**: Consciousness and perception are co-creative acts[^13]  
- **Nonlocal causality**: Information and influence can transcend spatial separation[^14]  
- **Biofield coherence**: Biological systems can synchronize with information fields in ways that challenge thermodynamic entropy and classical information theory[^15]
- **Two New Fundamental Forces**: Non-physical C-energy and T-energy respectively, whereas T-energy *connects* the non-physical C to the physical P.
-  The CTP Model provides this postquantum framework or the long-sought after 'new science beyond the Standard Model, whereas that it is NOT just a matter of *new physics* that is required, but must, however, also include a completely NEW post-quantum/non-physical epistemological framework while also offering and anteing up a **new paradigm** with it as the same.

In this model, scientific method is expanded—not discarded—to include **subjective-verifiable interface phenomena**, such as remote sensing, intuitive diagnostics, energy healing, and interspecies communication[^16].

## Section IV: Bridging Anomalies to Architecture

Many fields have hinted at CTP principles without unification:

- **Remote viewing (RV)** demonstrates intentional data acquisition across space-time[^17]  
- **Biofield healing** shows modulation of human physiology through invisible fields[^18]  
- **Backster's Primary Perception** experiments illustrate emotional signaling between humans and plants with no delay or conventional medium[^8]

CTP Science doesn't dismiss these as outliers—it **systematizes** them into a coherent framework of postquantum bioenergetics. It provides the mathematical, theoretical, and philosophical *glue* that connects these seemingly disparate phenomena.

## Section V: Technological and Scientific Implications

CTP Energy Science opens the door to a new class of technologies:

- **Hyper-spatial communication systems**: Enabling real-time data transfer without electromagnetic radiation[^19]  
- **Consciousness-based diagnostics**: Tools that interpret changes in local CTP fields to detect disease, emotional trauma, or energetic imbalance[^20]  
- **Bio-resonant architecture**: Environments designed to align with and enhance the coherence of human CTP fields[^21]  
- **Energy systems driven by intention**: Harnessing CTP principles for non-electromagnetic energy transfer[^22]

**CTP Technologies** will not merely be inventions; they will be **extensions of consciousness**, co-evolving with the users who engage them.

## Conclusion: From Fringe to Framework

CTP Energy Science represents not just a new *branch* of science, but a **new scaffold for knowing**—one that integrates first-person experience, biofield interaction, and consciousness as co-fundamentals of reality.

In a postquantum world, science must be redefined. The next breakthroughs won’t come from particle colliders or telescopes alone—but from those brave enough to look inward, engage the subtle, and accept that reality is not only physical—it is participatory, field-driven, and profoundly alive.
