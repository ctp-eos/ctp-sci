# Basic Background

If we are spiritual beings, which we are, then just as our physical body is made of atoms and molecules, our spiritual or C-body must be made of something, and it is. It is made of units of Conscious energy or C-energy Units.

C-energy Units also exist behind all atoms and matter we see in our physical universe. The physical world or P-domain is a natural domain of our physical or P-body and atoms. The non-physical energy world or C-domain is a natural domain of our spiritual or C-body and the C-energy Units.

A C-energy Unit is the smallest unit of conscious or C-energy that can think on its own. Just as atoms of similar structure group together in P-domain to create different kinds of matter, units of C-energy of similar thinking group together in C-domain to form larger partnerships or entities each with a purpose of being something or someone in the P or C-domain, and each with its own unique overall C-energy frequency.

C-energy is invisible from our physical world. In C-Domain there is no time and no distance. Communication in C-domain is instant. Your thought is your instant action. There are no limitations of speed of light in C-domain as it applies to the Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity.

C-energy creates millions of non-physical and physical realities (including ours) each defined by its own range of C-energy frequencies not visible from another range or reality. Where you are in C-domain does not depend on the distance or physical location or travel.

Where you are in C-domain depends only on the range of C-energy frequencies you find yourself in and on the specific C-energy Frequency of your destination target in that range.

Groups of C-energy Units exhibit themselves in a physical world via a separate set of C-energy Units called Translational or T-energy Units which code the thoughts of such C-energy Units into the vibrations of a particular physical world. All atoms in our physical world are created and exist in this manner.

The constant interaction between C, T and P energies make up what we call the CTP Energy Cycle™. It can explain all current known and unknown science of our physical world. CTP Energy can also explain many spiritual, psychic, UFO, ESP, weather, and other similar phenomena.

For example, the expansion of galaxies in our physical Universe is nothing more than the expansion of C-energy in C-domain as coded by T-energy Units in our physical world. CTP Energy Cycle™ is also the elusive Unified Field Theory that scientists have been trying to formulate unsuccessfully for over 100 years since the formula always required a non-physical energy component to make it work.

Full understanding of the CTP Energy Cycle™ will one day lead to the development of various CTP Energy Systems.

One CTP System will allow for control of the gravity field, another will allow an instant communication with anyone via C-domain regardless of distance or reality involved, and yet another will allow for near instant travel to a destination in C-domain via your C-body or via a physical spaceship using the C-Energy Frequency Modulator™, plus many other revolutionary inventions.

Greater understanding of C-energy will also improve your life, your health, your state of mind and your understanding of who you really are.
