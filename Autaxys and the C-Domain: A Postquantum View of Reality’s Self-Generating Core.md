# Autaxys and the C-Domain: A Postquantum View of Reality’s Self-Generating Core

## Abstract

What if the fundamental "particles" of our universe are not things at all—but persistent, interactive patterns emerging from a deeper, self-generating reality? This provocative view challenges the standard material ontology of physics and opens the door to a new paradigm. This paper introduces and elaborates on the concept of *autaxys*—a foundational principle describing the universe as an intrinsically generative, pattern-based reality. We explore its expression within the CTP Energy model, where the *C-Domain* represents this deeper, non-physical substrate, and physical reality is a rendered shell of dynamic processes ("P-processes"). Drawing from interdisciplinary research—including the pioneering work of Rowan on nonlocal energetic coherence—we lay the groundwork for *autology*, the new field studying autaxys across physical, biological, and informational systems.

## 1. Introduction: Beyond the Particle Ontology

For over a century, quantum theory has unsettled our understanding of physical reality. Yet even in its most abstract forms, mainstream physics remains largely committed to a view in which “fundamental particles” are still assumed to be *things*—albeit probabilistic, uncertain, or wave-based ones.

But what if this premise is flawed? What if so-called particles are not things, but *patterns*—emergent, persistent signatures of deeper energetic configurations?

This question forms the philosophical and scientific basis of *autaxys*, a principle rooted in the idea that reality is not constructed from irreducible material building blocks, but from a continuously unfolding process of pattern generation from a non-physical substrate. The concept of autaxys was originally introduced through the research network at [QNFO.org](https://qnfo.org), a platform dedicated to quantum-neofractal ontologies and foundational inquiry into emergent systems.

## 2. The CTP Framework: From the C-Domain to Physical Reality

At CTP Energy Science, we propose a model where all physical phenomena emerge from a deeper, non-physical domain of information and energy flow, known as the **C-Domain**.

- **C-Domain**: The creative, causal substrate of reality. It is non-physical, nonlocal, and intrinsically generative.
- **P-Domain**: The rendered or “projected” domain of physical processes, which emerge from the C-Domain via what we call **CTP Energy**.
- **CTP Energy**: The interface mechanism by which the C-Domain expresses itself into structured physicality. It includes informational, energetic, and temporal components.

In this view, the "quantum particles" we observe are not entities per se, but rather **"pixels"**—temporary, interactive process events—rendered at the outer shell of a deeper computational-experiential engine. This aligns with autaxys, which posits that such particles are **interference patterns** within a larger, self-ordering matrix.

## 3. Autaxys: The Principle of Intrinsic Generativity

**Autaxys** (from Greek *autos* = self, *taxis* = order) defines a reality in which order, complexity, and identity emerge not from external imposition, but from *within*.

Autaxys suggests:

- The universe is not built but *woven*.
- Information is not passive but *creative*.
- Laws are not fixed absolutes but *emergent constraints*.

This framework resonates with cybernetic theories, pancomputational ontology, and certain interpretations of quantum mechanics *(e.g., QBism, relational quantum mechanics)*. However, autaxys provides a unifying postquantum substrate: a process-based engine of emergence rather than a field of pre-existing particles.

## 4. Autology: A New Science of Emergent Order

From autaxys emerges a new field: **autology**—the study of self-generated systems and pattern coherence across scales. Autology intersects disciplines including:

- **Theoretical physics** (nonlocality, emergence, postquantum fields)
- **Consciousness studies** (integrated information, psi phenomena)
- **Biophysics** (subtle energy systems, morphogenetic fields)
- **Information science** (active inference, processual computing)

Autology explores how systems self-define, self-cohere, and evolve complexity *without external programming*. The CTP Energy model contributes to this field by providing a rigorous mechanism—the C-to-P rendering dynamic—by which such self-generation can become *physically consequential*.

## 5. Third-Party Support: Rowan and the C-Domain Hypothesis

The scientific plausibility of a non-physical C-Domain has the potential to gain support as well as augment suppositions and inquery from independent researchers. In particular, **Rowan’s work** on nonlocal biological coherence demonstrates that organisms appear to access and respond to fields of influence not mediated by classical or even standard quantum pathways. Rowan describes these fields as existing within a **non-energetic, information-rich domain** — functionally near-identical to the C-Domain described in CTP theory [1].

Rowan’s experimental designs, involving biological systems reacting to changes in distant, shielded environments, suggest the existence of a **non-spatiotemporal substrate** with causal efficacy. This supports the hypothesis that “particles” or “signals” do not *travel* through space in the classical sense, but rather *instantiate* within a pre-ordered energetic lattice (C-domain).

These findings are complemented by earlier work in:

- **Cleve Backster’s biocommunication experiments** [2]
- **Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic field hypothesis** [3]
- **David Bohm’s implicate order** [4]

Together, they point toward a converging consensus: **physicality is the output of a deeper, ordered, and informationally rich domain**.

## 6. Rethinking Matter, Energy, and Information

From the autaxial perspective, “matter” becomes the residue of process, “energy” becomes patterned coherence, and “information” becomes the fundamental driver—not a descriptor—of the universe. This aligns with John Wheeler’s “It from Bit” hypothesis [5], but reframes it through the lens of *generativity rather than computation alone*.

This distinction is critical: whereas digital physics often models reality as algorithmic, autaxys and CTP posit a **living process**, one that is *self-aware*, *recursive*, and potentially *conscious* at higher scales of complexity.

## 7. Conclusion: A Postquantum Universe of Patterns

Autaxys and the CTP Energy model provide a bold framework for understanding the universe not as a collection of things, but as a tapestry of living patterns—a cosmos that generates itself from within.

By recognizing the C-Domain as the true definitive non-physical substrate of emergent reality, we move beyond debates about particles and waves, materialism and dualism, and enter a new terrain of inquiry—one where creativity, coherence, and emergence are fundamental via a completely new postquantum/non-physical unified epistemological model and higher *(dare we say 'higher dimensional/non-physical)* fundamental framework encompassing the total nature of CTP-reality.

The foundational paper, **[“Autaxys and Autology: Definition, Rationale, and Implications,”](https://qnfo.org/projects/AUTX/AUTX_D002_Draft_v1.2)** lays out the terminological scaffolding for this framework and invites critical engagement from the scientific, philosophical, and technological communities.
