# CTP Energy Science vs Annaka Harris's Work on Consciousness

Annaka Harris's exploration of consciousness, particularly in her article “Consciousness All the Way Down: The Next Scientific Revolution?”, challenges prevailing scientific paradigms by positing that consciousness may be a fundamental aspect of reality, not merely an emergent property of complex neural processes. While this perspective invites a re-examination of foundational assumptions in various scientific disciplines, it still operates within frameworks that may not fully account for models like those proposed by CTP Energy Science (CTPSci), which posit consciousness as arising from non-physical C-energy Units.

## 1. The Limitations of Emergentist and Panpsychist Views

Harris critiques the emergentist view, highlighting the lack of empirical evidence explaining how subjective experience (qualia) arises from physical processes. She suggests that this gap indicates a need to consider consciousness as a fundamental component of the universe, akin to space or time. This aligns with panpsychism, which posits that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality.

However, even panpsychism faces challenges, such as the "combination problem," which questions how simple forms of consciousness combine to form complex experiences. Harris proposes viewing consciousness as a pervasive field, analogous to spacetime, to address this issue. A noble attempt, however, does not complete the model required to explain it.

## 2. CTP Energy Science: A Distinct Framework

CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) offers a different perspective by proposing that consciousness is generated via non-physical C-energy Units that reside with the **C-domain**. This model suggests that consciousness does not emerge from physical processes but is instead a fundamental aspect of a non-physical energetic substrate - that exists within its own non-physical energy domain *(outside of spacetime)*. In this view, the brain acts as an interpreter or receiver of consciousness, rather than its generator.

This framework challenges both emergentist and panpsychist models by introducing a non-material basis for consciousness, suggesting that current scientific paradigms may be insufficient to fully explain conscious experience.

## 3. Implications for Scientific Paradigms

The idea of consciousness as arising from non-physical C-energy Units necessitates a paradigm shift, reminiscent of past scientific revolutions. Such a shift would require integrating subjective experience into the fabric of scientific inquiry *(adding the inclusions of two additional non-physical Fundamental Forces/carriers)*, challenging the objective-only stance traditionally held. For CTPSci, this means expanding research methodologies to include interdisciplinary approaches that account for consciousness not just as a byproduct but as an integral element of physical theories - and that physical reality itself is an ***'outer-layer'*** overlaying a non-physical/non-material substrate.

## 4. Conclusion

Annaka Harris’s exploration urges a reconsideration of the foundational assumptions in scientific research. By entertaining the possibility that consciousness is fundamental, she challenges disciplines to broaden their theoretical frameworks. However, models like those proposed by CTP Energy Science suggest that even these expanded frameworks may not fully capture the nature of consciousness, highlighting the need for new, potentially unifying perspectives in understanding reality. The **CTP Model** and **CTP Energy** discovered by Drazen both offers and solves this reality-model and reality-dynamisms required.
