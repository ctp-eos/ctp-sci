## 10 Basic Rules of CTP Energy Science

<h1 align="center">10 Basic Rules of CTP Energy Science</h1>


**<span style="color:blue">Rule 1:</span>**  
A C-energy Unit is the smallest unit of Conscious Energy that can exist and think on its own. The non-physical domain where C-energy exists is called the C-domain.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 2:</span>**  
C-energy creates millions of non-physical and physical realities each defined by a narrow range of C-energy frequencies not visible from another range or reality.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 3:</span>**  
Units of C-energy of similar thinking group together in C-domain to form larger groups and partnerships each thinking of being someone or something in a physical or a non physical reality.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 4:</span>**  
Each entity made of C-energy Units has its own unique-distinct Group C-energy Frequency (GCF) that no other entity or group has anywhere in C-domain.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 5:</span>**  
Each group of C-energy Units creates its, his or her own reality. No one else imposes it. No one else creates it.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 6:</span>**  
A C-energy Unit creates an atom or a unit of force or physical energy in a physical world via another type of C-energy called Translational or T-energy Unit which codes the thoughts of a C-energy Unit into the vibrations of a particular physical world.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 7:</span>**  
Each physical world is defined by its own unique and dedicated set of T-energy Units coding everything that is visible in that physical world. Different T-energy Units that code different physical worlds can be “plugged into” the same group of C-energy Units in the C-domain.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 8:</span>**  
A thought sent by an entity seeks its destination in C-domain instantly by finding the target's GCF automatically. There is no re-broadcasting or resending of one’s thought by someone else in C-domain.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 9:</span>**  
Communication via C-domain is instant – no limitation of speed of light exists regardless of the distance or reality involved. There is also no sense of time or traveled distance in C-domain – you instantly find yourself at your destination in your C-body. Your thought is your instant action.

**<span style="color:blue">Rule 10:</span>**  
Non-physical C-energy does not create or interact directly with any physical or P-energy. It needs a C-body connected to a physical or P-body or T-energy to affect changes in a physical world.

**Remember your history**: Newton's Three Laws of Motion defined a new era in physics.

Drazen's CTP Energy Science/CTPSci Sciences Rules introduce 10 new laws that apply to principles of the non-physical C-domain.
