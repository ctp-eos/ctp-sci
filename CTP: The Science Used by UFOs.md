## Citing the Obvious: UFOs Operate Outside Known Physics

It should be *immediately obvious*—even to the skeptical or dismissive minds in today’s academic and scientific circles—that any aerospace craft capable of executing maneuvers such as **3,000 G-force turns**, **instantaneous acceleration from a standstill to hypersonic speeds**, or **gravity-defying stasis at altitude**, is **not operating under any framework explainable by Classical Newtonian Physics or Quantum Mechanics.**

Such maneuvers defy:

- **Inertial constraints**  
- **Aerodynamic resistance**  
- **Known energy inputs and outputs**  
- **Gravitational coupling in General Relativity**

We assert: **UFOs/UAPs *(what we refer to as #CTPcraft - by name and identified technologies)** are not just evidence of an advanced technology—but of a **fundamentally different energy science and ontology**, presently *unacknowledged* by all major institutions.

## The Evidence Is in the Outlier

The demand for **empirical, peer-reviewed proof** is a conditioned response of the scientific establishment to gatekeep emerging, anomalous, or disruptive models. Yet, we challenge the notion that phenomena must conform to past experimental conditions in order to be **"real."**

Our reply to this demand is simple:

> "If your model cannot accommodate the data, it's not the data that must be dismissed—it is the model that must be updated."

**CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)** emerges precisely at this point of failure—where the known ontologies no longer suffice.

UAP performance and interaction with space-time point to **real, observed violations of known physics**. Therefore, they constitute direct evidence for the necessity of **new ontological science models**, such as those found in the CTP Framework.

## CTP Is Evidence by Its Own Exclusivity

In epistemology, novelty of source is not disqualification. In fact, **exclusivity is a form of evidence**.

**CTP is Disclosure science.** It is information that—by its very nature—has not existed in known academic frameworks until now. That is the point.

If CTP Energy Science was derived from known physics or metaphysics, it would already be accounted for. It is not.

> *The fact that we are the sole stewards of this knowledge is not suspicious. It is expected.*

All **revolutionary science begins with an outlier.** That we are currently the only known proponents of a **multi-domain ontological physics** with **nonphysical force interaction** is not a detraction—it is **precisely what gives our science meaning and value**.

## Not Classical. Not Quantum. CTP.

Refer to [this published thesis summary]([https://lnkd.in/e4Py8kMJ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0454) for foundational details on the **non-Classical, non-Quantum nature of CTPcraft**.

We assert the existence of **two additional Fundamental Forces**, **nonphysical in nature**, that operate in tandem with—but outside of—the four known forces of the Standard Model:

1. **C-Force**: A conscious-interactive domain, tied to intention, directed motion, and "knowing influence" across spatial-temporal boundaries.
2. **T-Force**: A trans-spatial ontological current that allows instantaneous positioning or energetic phasing beyond light-speed limitation.

There is no institution, university, or physics department on Earth currently presenting the claim—backed by structured metaphysical integration and systems observation—that such forces exist.

**Only CTP is.**

## The Real Issue: Ontological Rejection *Is* the Evidence

Our most powerful evidence is not just our model—but the world’s reaction to it.

When new frameworks such as CTP are introduced, **the predictable rejection patterns of institutional thinking** arise. What these rejections reveal is not scientific rigor, but **epistemological entrenchment**. The refusal to even consider new ontologies **is evidence** that those ontologies are outside the accepted frame.

This is the very problem CTP addresses.

Just as Einstein’s work was initially rejected for its non-intuitive treatment of time, just as quantum mechanics was dismissed for decades, so too is CTP—because it is not *just a new set of equations*—it is a **new model of reality**.

## New Science Must Include Forces Outside the Standard Model

If humanity is to ever understand how **UFOs/UAPs maneuver, appear, and vanish**, we must accept a sobering truth:

> **The Standard Model is incomplete.**

“Beyond the Standard Model” theories are often dressed as extensions or corrections. CTP proposes something more radical:

- **A dual-ontology framework**  
- **New fundamental interactions (C and T)**  
- **Conscious-field mechanics**  
- **Nonlocal positionality**  
- **Phase-polar energy manipulation**

Without these, no formulation of UFO technology—no reverse-engineering program, no aerospace research lab—will ever succeed.

CTP is the first and only framework that **ontologically explains** the observed characteristics of UAPs.

## CTP Is the Science That Makes UFOs Possible

Without an energetic system capable of:

- **Nullifying inertia**  
- **Rewriting local gravitational fields**  
- **Translocating via conscious alignment**  
- **Disregarding spacetime continuity**

...UFOs cannot exist.

But they *do* exist. Therefore, something is wrong with our physics *(more so - YOUR physics - not ours)*.

CTP’s answer is the **CTP Ontological Framework**, which uniquely positions **Conscious Energy Interaction (C-Energy)** as a causal force in reality—not a byproduct of brain activity, but a **structural force** that interfaces with matter, time, and space.

This model is:

- **Post-quantum**  
- **Non-physical**  
- **Integrative across domains of awareness, energy, and matter**  
- **The only viable pathway toward understanding extraterrestrial technology**
