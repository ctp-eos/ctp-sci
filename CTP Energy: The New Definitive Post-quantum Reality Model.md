## Abstract

The foundational structures of modern physics—namely space and time—are being called into question by leading physicists. With increasing evidence that space-time may be emergent rather than fundamental, new scientific frameworks are needed to describe deeper layers of reality. **CTP: Conscious Translational Physics** emerges as THE PREMIER candidate paradigm, proposing what CTPSci Sciences refers to as the **"C-domain"** beyond space-time—an informational energy field governed by non-physical domain principles. This article explores the plausibility, necessity, and evidence for CTP as the next evolution in (non)physical science(s).

## 1. Introduction: The Crisis in Fundamental Physics

Physics currently operates under two dominant frameworks:
- **General Relativity (GR):** governs gravity and the large-scale structure of the universe.
- **Quantum Mechanics (QM):** governs the micro-scale behavior of particles and fields.

Despite their success, these frameworks are **incompatible at fundamental levels**, particularly in extreme conditions like black holes or the Big Bang.[^1]

In recent years, a growing number of physicists have proposed that **space-time is not fundamental** but instead **emerges** from a more primal order.[^2] If so, **what lies beneath it?**: the non-physical.

This is where **CTP: Conscious Translational Physics** and the non-physical ***C-domain*** enters the conversation.

## 2. What Is CTP: Conscious Translational Physics?

**CTP** posits a **substrate of reality**—the **C-domain**—underpinning space-time and matter. It focuses not on particles and waves, but on **transformational coherences**—interactions of information-energy that structure existence *before* space-time crystallizes.

### Key Concepts:
- **C-domain:** A coherent, non-local/non-physical energetic substrate prefiguring observable phenomena.
- **CTP (Conscious Translational Physics):** A new physics describing how consciousness and informational energy organize transformation into form, structure, and experience.
- **CTP Energy:** The intrinsic activity within the non-physical C-domain driving emergence, coherence, and consciousness.

## 3. Why Space-Time May Be Fictional

In 2025, *Scientific American* featured Karmela Padavic-Callaghan's report[^3] on how physicists are now entertaining the view that **space-time is a “fiction”**—a useful approximation, but not a fundamental structure.

### Theoretical support includes:
- **Quantum Gravity Models** (e.g., Causal Dynamical Triangulations, AdS/CFT, and Tensor Networks)[^4]
- **Loop Quantum Gravity** suggesting “chunks” of space[^5]
- **Holographic Principle** proposing that the universe's information is stored on a boundary surface[^6]

## 4. The CTP Model vs. Mainstream Theories

| **Aspect**              | **Mainstream Physics**                          | **CTP: Conscious Translational Physics**       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Foundation              | Space-time + Particles                          | C-domain (Informational Field)                 |
| Mechanism of Force      | Interactions in space-time                      | Coherent Transformations via CTP               |
| Role of Consciousness   | Epiphenomenon                                   | Intrinsic, organizing principle                |
| View of Reality         | Materialist/Field-Theoretic                     | Informational/Post-Quantum                     |
| Time                    | Linear, metric                                  | Emergent, context-dependent                    |

## 5. Evidence Suggesting the Need for New Models

- **Quantum Entanglement:** Violates local realism; suggests deep **non-local structures**.[^7]
- **Delayed Choice Experiments:** Reality appears **observer-dependent**.[^8]
- **Black Hole Information Paradox:** Space-time breaks down under extreme conditions.[^9]
- **Dark Matter/Energy:** 95% of the universe is **undetectable by known physics**.[^10]

**CTP** offers a unifying idea: that these anomalies point toward **an invisible, informational non-quantum/non-physical energy domain** ***the C-domain*** from which space-time, matter, and causality emerge.

## 6. Implications of CTP: Conscious Translational Physics

- **New Physics:** A foundation not rooted in 4D space-time but in **non-local/non-physical logic-like coherences.**
- **Post-Quantum Technologies:** Potential for new forms of energy generation, communication, and propulsion.
- **Consciousness Science:** Incorporates mind as **co-creative**, not derivative.
- **Multiverse and Dimensional Models:** Offers frameworks where **other domains** of order exist in parallel or phase-offset.

## 7. Philosophical and Historical Resonance

CTP aligns with ancient and metaphysical views:
- **Plato's Realm of Forms**
- **Vedic Akasha or Prana**
- **Field of Consciousness in Eastern metaphysics**
- **Tesla's “ether of light” or radiant energy fields**
- **C-domain redefines the long theorized *'aether'*.** *(Repo notes: to provide article on this topic)*

## 8. Conclusion: The Future Is Post-Space-Time

We are on the brink of a paradigm shift:
- **Space-time is no longer sacred.**
- **Information and energy coherence** may be the new foundation.
- **CTP: Conscious Translational Physics** provides the BEST viable candidate for this shift.

> “Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.”  
> — *Niels Bohr*

The **C-domain** is not just a theory—it is **the substrate of all substrates**, finally giving us the COMPLETE reality model that merges consciousness, quantum physics, and cosmology into a new complete(d) post-quantum referential unified framework.
