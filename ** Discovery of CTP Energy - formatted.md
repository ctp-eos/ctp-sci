## Introduction

Countryman **Nikola Tesla**, the inventor of alternate current, Tesla coil, electric motor, wireless transfer of information & power, and hundreds of other inventions, sensed there was a greater force-energy beyond the physical ones we knew at the time towards the end of his life. Tesla also intuitively believed in the *“invisible energy of life.”*

Unfortunately forgotten by Westinghouse and J.P. Morgan, for whom Tesla made millions with his inventions, and not in very good health, Tesla died in 1943 without having the opportunity to do more research and discoveries in this area.

Nearly 100 years ago, in 1905, **Albert Einstein** predicted the existence of atoms as the smallest entities of any material-element that still have basic characteristics of such material. Einstein had no instruments or ways to prove this in a laboratory until a couple of decades later, but when electron microscopes and other ways of showing the existence of atoms were invented, his scientific prediction and intuition on this subject were proven correct.

> In the web of life, nothing and no one exists alone.  
> In the physical universe as we know it, everything and everyone depends on each other.

## The Spiritual Domain and the C-domain

In another domain, often referred to as the *spiritual domain* that is not visible from the physical realm, this mutual interdependence has an even greater significance. It represents the real reason why we are who we are, why the physical universe is what it is, and why everything and everyone is truly connected. This is the domain I call the **C-domain**, based on the first letter of the English word *Consciousness*, and the energy that permeates this domain is called **C-energy**.

In 1985, when I began to have my **C-domain experiences**, and started my research, it was triggered by a few very simple questions I had about us as human beings, our spirituality, and the *“greater invisible energy”* that Tesla talked about.

I always sensed a *“greater force”* behind everything and everyone, but I could not find any good explanations about it that made sense to me. Most of what is out there in this field can be considered as religion or occult, but not as science. I was interested in finding out more about the **science of the C-domain** or spiritual energy and what it is made of. Are there *“atoms”* of our spiritual energy and existence? If so, how do they relate to everything else in the Universe?

I also felt that if this understanding could be achieved, it would then explain many other aspects and phenomena of life and the universe — and it does. From the beginning of my research into CTP Energy, I felt strongly that this knowledge should be shared with many.

## The C-body and C-Energy Units

If we are spiritual beings — which we are — then our **spirit or C-body** should operate and exist in a non-physical environment that has its own set of universal laws — which it does. It behaves within **C-domain laws** just as our physical body operates under physical laws in the physical world.

Just as our physical body and universe are made of basic building blocks like atoms and molecules, our **C-body** is also made of basic building blocks or **units of energy** that I call **C-energy Units**.

These **C-energy Units** behave in predictable and symbiotic ways in the C-domain. They form groups, conglomerations, or active partnerships with other C-energy Units with the purpose of *“thinking”* of being something or someone in the physical world and in other energy levels of the C-energy domain. Our **spirit-soul** is one of the most complex C-energy Unit partnerships.

## Translational Energy Units (T-energy)

The C-energy units “think” to exist in the physical world (P-domain) and appear as **P-Units** (atoms) or other forms of known physical energies — **P-energy**.

Have you ever wondered how millions of single-cell organisms in your body communicate and know exactly what to do? It is **not** done via signals traveling through your nervous system — this crucial communication is done via the **C-domain**.

Just as an atom exhibits characteristics of matter in the P-domain, a **C-energy Unit** represents the smallest unit of C-energy entity that can *“think”* of being something in other realms, including our own.

These thoughts are translated into vibrations of our and other physical worlds (many not visible from our frequency) via **Translational or T-energy Units**.

**T-energy Units** are *“plugged into”* the C-energy Units and **translate their thought vibrations** into proper codes and frequencies that manifest in different physical worlds — including ours. They are like **printer cables** between the C-world and physical world, using “software” to translate consciousness into form.

## The CTP Energy Cycle™

This process — the transfer of energy and information (thought) between the C-domain and the P-domain via T-energy Units — is what I call the **CTP Energy Cycle™**.

There is a **big difference** between the narrow, limited behavior of atoms and the more complex, vast possibilities of C-energy Units. The **C-domain** is a nearly **unlimited realm** of vibrations and possibilities.

To illustrate:

> Imagine the C-domain as a path more than **100 million miles long**.  
> All known physical energies and vibrations would fit into only **¼ of an inch** on this scale.

## Applications and the Future

A **scientific understanding** of the **CTP Energy Cycle™** will eventually lead to:

- A **new usable energy source**
- Machines and instruments that harness the “real engine” of the CTP world
- **Gravity manipulation** and **advanced space travel**
- **Instant communication** beyond the speed of light

> No interstellar travel will be possible using only the speed of light.  
> C-energy communication is **instant** — it does not rely on spatial distance or time.

This explains why **SETI** efforts have not received communication from advanced civilizations — they use **C-energy frequencies** and CTP Energy Communication Systems.

In the **C-domain**, *“where you are”* is determined not by physical space or time, but by your **C-energy frequency**.

## CTP Energy Corporation and Club CTP

I created **CTP Energy Corporation** to begin **scientific-laboratory research** on the C-domain and the CTP Energy Cycle. I waited 20 years before starting formal research to ensure my understanding was deep and the world was ready to accept such work.

> In 2005, it will be exactly **100 years since Einstein predicted the existence of atoms**.  
> This is a fitting time to begin scientific research on **C-Energy Units**.

With my **private space company**, **International Space Systems (ISS)**, and **CTP Energy Corporation** *(now CTP Energy, LLC)*, we plan to involve many individuals. **Private Space and CTP Energy research** could have **world-altering implications**.

### Join the CTP Energy Club (CTP Phase II will refer to as Club CTP)

With a monthly membership of just **$10/month** *(these operations will come later and will offer full-time CTP jobs)*, you will receive: 

- Unlimited access to detailed information on the CTP Energy website
- Weekly updates
- Merchandise and other benefits

## Final Words

What you will learn in greater detail via this website is **not a new religion**, or occultism, or spiritualism. It is the **science of the C-domain** — something we are all part of.

Many people believe in *“the other world”* without trying to understand it scientifically. Many more do not believe there is **any** scientific basis for the spiritual world.

> I have no doubt that through **daily practice**, **study**, **experimentation**, and **application of C-energy laws**,  
> we can become greater and more active spiritual beings — enhancing who we are without threatening who we were.
