# Discovery of CTP Energy

Original article - first post/published August 2004

(Written by Drazen Premate based on research and experiences since 1985)

Countryman Nikola Tesla, the inventor of alternate current, Tesla coil, electric motor, wireless transfer of information & power, and hundreds of other inventions, sensed there was a ***greater force-energy*** beyond the physical ones we knew at the time towards the end of his life, and Tesla also intuitively believed in the *“invisible energy of life”*. Unfortunately forgotten by Westinghouse and J.P Morgan for whom Tesla made millions with his inventions, and not in a very good health, Tesla died in 1943 without having opportunity to do more research and discoveries in this area.

Nearly 100 years ago in 1905 Albert Einstein predicted the existence of atoms as the smallest entities of any material-element that still have basic characteristics of such material. Einstein had no instruments or ways to prove this in laboratory until a couple of decades later, but when electron microscope and other ways of showing existence of atoms were invented, his scientific prediction and intuition on this subject were proven correct.

In the web of life nothing and no one exists alone. In the physical universe as we know it, everything and everyone depends on each other.

In another domain, often referred to as the spiritual domain that is not visible from the physical realm, this mutual interdependence has an even greater significance relative to the physical world we live in. It represents the real reason why we are who we are, why the physical universe is what it is, and why everything and everyone is truly connected. This is the domain that I call **C-domain** based on the first letter of the English word ***Consciousness***, and the energy that permeates this domain **the C-energy**.

In 1985 when I began to have my C-domain experiences and I have started my research of it, it all got triggered by a few very simple questions I had about us as human beings and our spirituality and the *“greater invisible energy”* that Tesla talked about.

I always sensed a *“greater force”* behind everything and everyone, but I could not find any good explanations about it that made sense to me. Most of what is out there in this field can be considered as religion or occult, but not as science, and I was interested in finding out more about the science of the C-domain or spiritual energy and what it is made of. Are there *“atoms”* of our spiritual energy and existence, and if so, how they relate to everything else in the universe?

I also felt if this understanding could be achieved it would then explain many other aspects and phenomena of life and universe, and it does. I also felt strongly the same knowledge should be shared with many from the very beginning of my research of CTP Energy.

If we are spiritual beings, which we are, then our spirit or C-body should operate and exist in a **non-physical environment** that has its own set of **universal laws**, *which it does*. It behaves there within C-domain laws similarly as our physical body operates in the physical world under physical laws that are uniform everywhere and apply to **everyone** equally.

Just as our physical body and universe is made of basic building blocks of the physical world called atoms and molecules, our C-body is also made of certain basic building blocks or units of energy that I call ***C-energy Units***.

Just as atoms make up the minimal physical reality of the matter that exists in the physical world, the C-energy Units are basic building blocks of our spirit or C-body and all other C-energies that exist in the C-domain which then define many physical universes.

Just as atoms do so in the physical world, C-energy Units also behave in certain predictable and symbiotic way in the C-domain. They create groups, conglomerations or active partnerships with other C-energy Units with a simple purpose of *“thinking”* of being something or someone in the physical world and in other energy levels of the C-energy domain. Our spirit-soul is one of the most complex C-energy Units partnerships.

The C-energy units actually *“think”* to exist in the physical world (P-domain) and appear physical as P-Units (atoms) or as any other forms of known physical energies, P-energy. Have you ever wondered how millions of single cell organisms living in your body communicate with each other and know exactly what to do? It is not done via signals traveling via your nervous system – this important communication is done via C-domain.

Just as an atom exhibits in its smallest form the characteristics of a particular matter in the P-domain, a C-energy unit represents in its most basic form the smallest unit of C-energy entity that can *“think”* of being something in other realms (energies/vibrations), including our own physical universe.

These *“thoughts”* of one or more C-energy units are then translated into vibrations of our and other physical worlds *(and most not visible from the frequency of our physical world)* via another set of energy units that I call ***Translational*** or T-energy Units.

This is what ***T-energy Units*** do and are about relative to the connection between the **C-domain** and **P-domain**. T-energy Units are *“plugged into”* the C-energy Units and translate their thought vibrations into the proper codes and frequencies which then exhibit themselves in different physical worlds including ours. T-energy Units are the printer cables of the C-world that with *“proper software”* connect our physical world to the C-domain and vice versa.

This process of energy and information or thought transfer between the C-domain and the P-domain via T-energy Units is what I call the ***CTP Energy Cycle™***.

There is a big difference relative to a narrow and limited behavior of the individual atoms in the physical universe and the behavior of their relative C-energy Units in the C-domain. C-energy Units operate and exist in the vast and nearly unlimited realm of the C-energy world or domain of many more possibilities and energy levels.

How can one describe in the physical-world sense the size and the endless diversity of the C-energy domain? Picture all possible energy levels/vibrations/frequencies or existences in the C-domain as a path more than 100 million miles long, then all known energies and vibrations of our physical world covered by the science of today would fit into a length of only a ¼ of an inch! Anything outside this ¼ of an inch on this more than hundred million-mile long path we cannot see or touch from the P-domain and thus has been virtually totally unknown to us.

The CTP Energy Cycle™ defines the close relationship and the interdependence between the C-domain and the physical world or P-domain. A scientific understanding of the same will eventually lead to the development of a whole new usable energy source. This CTP Energy Cycle™ understanding will also lead to the design and use of machines and instruments that can harness the *“real engine”* of the CTP world without the use of or burning part of the energy of the physical world.

This CTP Energy Systems will be able to one day manipulate gravity and thus allow for space travel today only seen in science fiction movies. Also communication along C-energy Frequencies is instant – **there is no limit of speed of light** as exhibited in physical domain. No interplanetary, deep space, or interstellar space travel could ever happen if we would rely on speed of light speed only – it takes 92 minutes for one way communication to Cassini spacecraft around Saturn. And the closest star is over 4 light years away. Communication via C-domain and energies or frequencies of the same is instant.

There is a reason why all of **SETI** *(Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence)* efforts to date have not produced a confirmed communication from another civilizations. Many advanced civilizations exist in the total Universe and not just in ours as visible in the narrow range of frequencies of our physical world.

Some travel in our physical world but they use CTP Energy Communication system and C-domain energies and frequencies to instantly communicate with each other. In C-domain the *“where you are”* has nothing to do with your space *(how far away you are from your original departing point)* and your time location *(how long ago you left)*, but *“where you are”* has to do with your C-energy Frequency – it defines your reality.

I have created **CTP Energy Corporation** to begin to work on scientific-laboratory research on this and many other aspects of C-domain and CTP Energy Cycle utilization. I have waited for nearly 20 years to do so since starting my personal research before starting with scinetific one to make sure my understanding of C-domain and CTP Energy is very high and that the world has reached greater level of acceptance of this kind of work and results. Some often referred to Nikola Tesla as *“Man out of Time”* because he was 20-50 years ahead of his time. Sometimes one has to let time catch up with oneself so one’s ideas are more acceptable by others.

Besides, next year in 2005, it will be exactly 100 years since Einstein predicted the existence of Atoms so it is appropriate that my actual scientific-laboratory research on my prediction that C-Energy Units exist starts on such an important scientific anniversary.

Just as I am doing with my private space company International Space Systems (ISS) in CTP Energy Corporation we plan to involve many individuals.  Private Space and CTP Energy research could have huge world-altering implications, if we are successful. Via your monthly membership to CTP Energy Club of just $10/month you will receive unlimited access to all much more detailed information on the ctp energy web site, weekly updates plus merchandise and other benefits.

What you will soon learn about in a greater detail via this Web site is not a new religion, or a new occult or a new spiritualism. It really is the science of something we are all part of all the time – the C-domain. So many of us assume it is sufficient to believe in “the other world” and not have to understand it on a scientific basis. Many more do not believe that there is a scientific basis for the spiritual or C-domain world at all.

I have no doubt from my own personal experience that it is through daily practice, study, repetition of experiments and application of the C-energy domain laws that we can become even greater and more active spiritual beings. This process can only enhance who we are in the physical world without really ever threatening who we were.
