# C-Domain: The Mind of God

## Introduction

The **C-domain** is the non-physical, conscious substrate of the universe‚Äîan immaterial source-field where what we call ‚Äúconsciousness,‚Äù ‚Äúwill,‚Äù ‚Äúspirit,‚Äù or ‚Äúintention‚Äù originates. It is from this domain that our **C-body**, or **consciousness-body**, and **C-energy units** arise **prior to physical incarnation**.

This is not a metaphor. The C-domain is **a real, primary layer of non-physical existence**, experienced subjectively and evidenced objectively through anomalous biological and physical responses. This domain is **not emergent from matter**‚Äîrather, **matter emerges as a representation or interface** of the C-domain when filtered through lower-energy structures *(e.g., the nervous system, DNA, or molecular receptors)*.

## The C-Domain and Pre-Incarnational Origin

Within the C-domain, a nonlocal, information-based architecture stores and transmits **identity, intention, memory, and emotion**. From this ‚Äúspiritual substrate,‚Äù individual conscious structures **(souls, C-bodies)** take shape **prior** to physical incarnation.

These structures:

- Are composed of **C-energy Units**, informational quanta of volition, memory, and presence.
- Interface with the brain-body system via **informational resonance**, not physical signals.
- Maintain **continuity of identity and memory** even outside space-time constraints.

In this way, **incarnation is a coupling event**: a non-physical C-body entangles with a biological system, forming a temporary material expression. Upon biological death, the C-body detaches and re-coheres *remains C-coherent or Conscious coherent with itself)* within the larger C-domain - and is eventually *reintegrated* with a larger C-energy Entity or CE Entity. 

This is also expressed as a larger CE Group *(or C-energy Group)* others widely refer to as a *Higher Self* - or larger conglomeration or group of other C-energy Units comprised of additional CE Entities *spun off* from the original *Higher Self*. At this higher level/higher domain of consciousness is in fact a form of a non-terrestrial Higher Intelligence *(contained within itself - capabable of interfacing with even higher levels of C-domain consciousness and other CE Groups also within the C-domain.)*

## Experimental and Third-Party Support

While mainstream science has struggled to frame this within traditional materialist paradigms, **multiple independent lines of research** have validated the reality of nonlocal biocommunication, consciousness-directed responses, and ‚Äúmind-over-matter‚Äù effects.

### üî¨ 1. Cleve Backster‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrimary Perception‚Äù Experiments

Backster, a former CIA polygraph expert, connected plants and human cells to galvanometers and discovered **instantaneous electrical responses** to human emotions‚Äîeven across great distances. His work demonstrates:

- Nonlocal coupling between human intention and cellular response.
- Memory and fear reactions in plants **absent any physical stimulus**.
- Parallel reactivity across space and species boundaries.

### üß™ 2. PEAR Lab: Consciousness Affects Physical Systems

The **Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) Lab** tested human intention against random number generators for over 25 years, compiling one of the largest statistical databases on mind-matter interaction.

Key findings:

- Human intention consistently deviates random systems from chance.
- Subjects often generated results **nonlocally**, even when not physically present.
- The effect sizes, though subtle, were **well beyond statistical randomness**.

### üõ∞Ô∏è 3. Remote Viewing and U.S. Government Programs

At SRI International, physicists Russell Targ and Hal Puthoff developed and demonstrated **remote viewing protocols** under CIA and military funding.

Findings included:

- Consistently accurate nonlocal perception of geographic sites and hidden targets.
- Data transmission that was **timeless and distance-independent**.
- Demonstrated that consciousness does not obey light-speed or locality constraints.

## C-Domain as a Foundational Informational Layer

Rather than proposing the C-domain as a philosophical idea, we present it as a **post-materialist scientific framework** for understanding:

- Where consciousness resides **prior to embodiment**.
- How **intention and perception** bypass physical limitations.
- Why **memory, identity, and volition** persist through death and distance.

The C-domain is **non-energetic in classical terms**, but informational and causal. It precedes light, mass, space, and time. All physical systems may be **surface-level ‚Äúreadouts‚Äù** of deep informational interactions occurring in this higher domain.

---

## Experimental and Theoretical Challenges

Despite the growing evidence base, the C-domain framework faces significant hurdles in academic science:

- **Operationalizing** and measuring non-physical information and consciousness.
- **Distinguishing** metaphysical intuition from replicable scientific models.
- Developing **formalisms** beyond standard mathematics to describe postquantum, postphysical layers of reality.

**Importantly**, mathematical representation may be inherently limited in describing domains **that are not symbol-based or metric-dependent**. New models will require hybrid systems of symbolic language, direct perception, and experimental validation.

## Future Innovation

Future CTP Energy Systems and CTP Technologies will allow anyone to travel the C-domain via one's C-body and directly recall memories/events and C-domain Experiences while outside of the physical body *(similar to NDE experiences, however, completely safe and with complete safety - and WITHOUT associated trauma to the phyysical or P-body)*.

## CTPSci Replication of C-domain Conditions

Replicating Drazen's conditions to fully experience C-domain presents a number of challenges. Future CTP Energy Systems will address these concerns and will provide a repeatable environment where ANYONE can and will be able to experience the C-domain, directly, without the human Ego-Mind filter in the way. 

- Training, study, and application of the CTPSci Sciences will/can lead anyone to better recall C-domain experiences incurred during one's sleep/rest cycle - as our C-body returns to C-domain each night.
- Note: *(This is 'how' Drazen extracted direct information knowledge and observations while in C-domain - where we return to each night during the sleep cycle. Drazen's exceptional mind(s) and the make up of his C-body was/were able to recall this C-domain acculumated information is beyond the capacities of most individuals.)*
- The issue is in that a human entity is much akin to a *'dual-boot'* partitioned Windows/Linux system and format(ted) where our non-physical C-body is structured in within two seperate groups of C-energy Units our non-physical C-body is comprised of.
- We have two separate C/P minds responsible for governing actions/memories per each C/P-domain of concurrent C/P-existence(s).

## Conclusion

The C-domain offers a coherent explanation for a host of otherwise anomalous phenomena‚Äînonlocal communication, post-death continuity, biofield interaction, and intentional healing. It is a **primary field of spiritual energy and informational structure**, from which our conscious experience arises and to which it returns.
