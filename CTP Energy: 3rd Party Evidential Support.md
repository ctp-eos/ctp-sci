# Third-Party Evidential Support for CTP Energy: Revisiting Nonlocal Biological Transport Phenomena

## Abstract

This article presents a scientific framework to validate the presence of a non-quantum, nonlocal bioenergetic transport mechanism termed **CTP Energy** (C-Energy), which operates through a distinct information and energy channel known as the **C-Domain**. 

Drawing on third-party research, particularly that of Cleve Backster and other non-conventional experimentalists, we explore electrochemical reactivity in biological samples physically separated from their sources and theorize that such interactions are evidence of a functional, measurable non-physical CTP transport mechanism. We propose that CTP Energy science provides a novel framework to unify fringe biology, parapsychology, and biocommunication under a single consistent domain theory.

## 1. Introduction

The concept of nonlocal non-physical communication between biological systems has been traditionally marginalized in mainstream science. 

The emergence of repeatable, empirical anomalies has necessitated a reevaluation of the energy domains involved in bioelectric signaling. The **CTP Model** —as introduced by CTP Energy Science— offers a transport mechanism not dependent on traditional electromagnetic or quantum channels but instead utilizes what is termed the non-physical **C-Domain architecture**, bridging spatially and temporally separated systems via coherent non-physical entanglement field/non-physically across the C-domain.

## 2. Cleve Backster’s Evidence of Nonlocal Biological Reactivity

In an interview conducted by Derrick Jensen [1], Cleve Backster—formerly a polygraph expert with the CIA—reported consistent experimental findings in which biological matter such as plant leaves, yogurt cultures, and human white blood cells exhibited measurable **electrochemical responses** to the emotional or mental state of a source human subject.

> "White cells taken from a person’s mouth and placed in a test tube still respond electrochemically to the donor’s emotional states, even when the donor is out of the room, out of the building, or out of the state." – Cleve Backster [1]

This anomalous reaction occurs in complete absence of any classical connection—whether neural, chemical, or electromagnetic—suggesting a **non-quantum** and **non-electromagnetic** mechanism. The principle is consistent with **CTP Energy’s assertion** that there exists a non-physical **C-domain carrier** operating as a transmission lattice through which information and state coherence are preserved across space and *(deeper non-local)* spatial distances.

## 3. Nature of the Carrier: CTP Energy vs. Quantum Nonlocality

Whereas quantum nonlocality describes correlations across entangled particles, the CTP Energy model asserts a *biologically-tuned carrier* that functions above the Planck scale and is accessible through high-coherence biophysical states (e.g., emotional focus, intent). Unlike quantum entanglement, CTP transport does not degrade with decoherence or environmental noise—making it applicable to **macro-scale, living systems**.

| Property                     | Quantum Entanglement      | CTP Energy (C-Domain)            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Scale                       | Subatomic                 | Cellular to planetary            |
| Sensitivity to decoherence  | High                      | Low                              |
| Reproducibility in organisms| Rare                      | High (per Backster and others)   |
| Mechanism                   | Probabilistic correlation | Directed informational transport |

## 4. Other Supporting Evidence

- **Rupert Sheldrake's Morphic Resonance**  
  Sheldrake’s theory of "form-resonance" fields complements the CTP model by suggesting the existence of fields that link organisms of similar types [2].

- **Dean Radin's Experiments**  
  Radin’s work in distant intentionality and mind-matter interaction confirms that subjects can affect physical systems at a distance [3].

- **EMF-Shielded Biocommunication Tests**  
  Studies showing correlations between EM-shielded biological systems (e.g., humans and EEG-linked plants) demonstrate interaction outside of conventional physics [4].

## 5. Basis of CTP Transport Mechanism

**CTP Energy Science** describes a transport system not limited by speed-of-light constraints. 

The **C-domain** is a non-local *(indeed non-physical)* informational C-field consciousness resides within the non-physical C-energy Units the non-physical C-body composed of - non-physically connected to a coherent non-spatial energy domain network—resembling a non-physical non-biological-origin-non-physical-non-spatial energy lattice (C-domain). 

This structure, when activated through coherent emotion or thought/C-energy intent, modulates a non-physical carrier field we refer to as **C-Energy** or non-physical **Conscious Energy** which exists in the corresponding non-physical C-domain. 

Physical braincells and physical brainwave activities *(alone)* would NOT be able to 'carry' information across these distances, thus a non-physical energy carrier *(C-energy and its respective non-physical domain (the C-domain)* is prerequisite and required to facilitate these outcomes and observances.

## 6. Implications for Consciousness, Healing, and Space Communication

The consistent remote electrochemical responsiveness of biological samples has implications in:

- **Remote diagnostics and healing** via biophoton emission and C-energy fields  
- **Extraterrestrial communication** leveraging non-electromagnetic coherent information transport  
- **Biological memory and field storage** using the C-domain as a distributed memory substrate  
- **Neuroscience and consciousness research**, bypassing synaptic and electromagnetic constraints

## 7. Conclusion

Cleve Backster’s third-party experimental findings—and those of researchers such as Sheldrake and Radin—form a growing body of evidence that supports the existence of a CTP transport mechanism; a non-physical medium, the C-energy and the C-domain.

The unique properties of **C-Energy and the C-Domain** propose a **new non-physical/biophysical layer of source-reality**, allowing for direct non-physical C-biological-to-biological communication beyond proximity, wiring, or standard quantum models. These phenomena are not paranormal—they are **hyper-normal**, representing an advanced energy science paradigm whose time has come" the CTPSci Sciences.
