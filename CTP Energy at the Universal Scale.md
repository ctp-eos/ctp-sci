# Third-Party Evidential Support for CTP Energy at the Universal Scale  
## Reinterpreting Cosmology Through the CTP Model

---

## Abstract

Contemporary cosmology acknowledges a deeply mysterious composition of the universe: 74% dark energy, 22% dark matter, and only 4% visible, physical matter. These observations highlight a crisis in theoretical physics—a gap in understanding what fundamentally constitutes the universe. The CTP Energy Model provides a coherent and explanatory framework that unifies consciousness, time structures, and physical energy phenomena into a three-tiered energy schema: **C-Energy**, **T-Energy**, and **P-Energy**. 

This article reinterprets current astrophysical data through this model, offering a structured solution to unresolved cosmological phenomena and presenting a holistic, post-quantum theory of energy and matter.

## 1. Introduction

The observable universe presents an extraordinary paradox: almost everything we can see, touch, and measure makes up less than 5% of the cosmos. The rest is categorized as "dark energy" and "dark matter"—terms that mask ignorance with nomenclature.

> **"We have a complete inventory of the universe, but only understand 4% of it."**  
> — Dr. Michael Turner, Cosmologist

The **CTP Model** (Consciousness–Time–Physicality) challenges this impasse by reframing energy not solely as a physical phenomenon but as a **conscious-temporal construct** that underpins all spacetime events.

## 2. The Current Cosmological Breakdown

Based on observational data from WMAP, Planck, and Type Ia supernova surveys, the universe is composed of:

- **74% Dark Energy**  
- **22% Dark Matter**  
- **3.6% Intergalactic Gas**  
- **0.4% Stars, Planets, Dust (ordinary matter)**

</div>

Yet despite knowing these proportions, modern science has **no direct empirical understanding** of the two dominant components.
- The **CTP Model** fits and summarizes better than any other contemporary explanation available to date.

## 3. The CTP Model Reinterpretation

The CTP Model introduces a new trinary energy framework:

| Energy Type        | Cosmic Correspondence | CTP Designation | Description                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dark Energy**    | 74%                   | **C-Energy**     | Non-physical, space-forming, intention-encoded structure    |
| **Dark Matter**    | 22%                   | **T-Energy**     | Different physical realities in other C-ranges of C-domain |
| **Physical Matter**| 4%                    | **P-Energy**     | Observable atoms, molecules, EM radiation                  |

## 4. Core Assertions of the CTP Model

### 4.1. C-Energy: The Conscious Substrate of Spacetime

- Represents **intentional structure** at the foundational level of the universe.  
- Analogous to **zero-point energy** or a structured quantum vacuum, but driven by consciousness or **coherence fields**.
- Explains **nonlocality**, the observer effect, and memory fields in biological systems[^1].

### 4.2. T-Energy: The Hidden Temporal Infrastructure

- Maps onto **dark matter** — gravitationally active but invisible.
- Functions as **time-wave scaffolding**, possibly correlated with Bohmian implicate order or Sheldrake's morphic fields[^2].
- Responsible for **temporal symmetry**, inertia, and systems memory.
- Evidences of P-energy in other C-ranges or C-energy Realities
- Physical C-energy Frequency Ranges (CeFR) of C-domain - not directly observable
- - though Gravity as a non-gauge force *'bleeds through'* to adjacent C-energy reality ranges.

### 4.3. P-Energy: Observable Physicality

- Limited to electromagnetic interactions, chemical matter, and baryonic visibility.
- Our current physics operates almost **exclusively in this range**.
- Explains why current instruments fail to detect or describe higher-layer dynamics.

## 5. Implications for Cosmology

| Problem in Current Cosmology      | CTP Model Explanation                                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What is dark energy?**         | C-Energy: structured, nonphysical but formative medium                 |
| **What is dark matter?**         | T-Energy: time-domain energy influencing gravity and inertia           |
| **Why is the universe expanding faster?** | C-Energy pushes space outward via conscious-field expansion |
| **Where is the missing baryonic matter?** | It's not "missing"—our model wrongly assumes only P-energy exists |
| **What underlies quantum entanglement?** | C-Energy allows real-time, nonlocal coupling across space-time |

## 6. Independent Evidence in Support of the CTP Model

### 6.1 Cleve Backster's Biocommunication Research  
Demonstrated instantaneous electrical responses in plant and microbial cells in the absence of traditional stimulus, indicating **nonlocal bioenergetic response fields**[^3].

### 6.2 PEAR Lab Experiments (Princeton)  
Human intention was shown to bias random number generators, suggesting that **consciousness affects probabilistic events** in physical systems[^4].

### 6.3 Del Giudice and Preparata’s Water Coherence Domains  
Water molecules align into **coherent electromagnetic domains**, suggesting that matter can store and transmit **subtle information fields**, a key attribute of T-energy[^5].

## 7. Theoretical Foundations Aligned with CTP

| Theory                           | Alignment                                                     |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations**  | Correlate with C-Energy behavior                              |
| **Bohmian Mechanics**            | Implicate order resembles T-Energy                            |
| **String Theory Extra Dimensions** | May map to T-energy domains                                |
| **Information Theory + Physics (Wheeler's 'It from Bit')** | Suggests universe arises from consciousness/information fields |

## 8. Conclusion: Why the CTP Model Solves the Universal Puzzle

The CTP framework not only **reinterprets the known structure of the cosmos** but offers explanatory power where current models remain speculative or silent. By recognizing that consciousness, time structure, and physical matter are **distinct but interrelated energy forms**, the CTP model may represent the next great paradigm shift in cosmology, akin to relativity or quantum mechanics.

It answers a critical question:  
> “Where—and what—is the rest of the universe?”

It’s right here. We’ve just been looking with the wrong instruments.
